RuneQuest 3e skill training calculator
====

```
Usage: rqt <current skill percentage> <number> <times|hours>
```

The calculator works in two modes:

* Given current skill and number of times to train the skill, how long will that take?
* Given current skill and number of hours to train the skill, how many times can the skill be incremented?

Employs calculations from _An integer programming approach RuneQuest 3e training calculations_ by Timothy Rice (2018).
